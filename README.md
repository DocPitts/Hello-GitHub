# Hello-GitHub
Learning to create a repository
I am 60 years old and due to health problems I am no longer able to do the work that I've been doing all my life. I am on a fixed
retirement income. With so much spare time and not being able to climb Mount Everest, I've decided to teach myself coding. My current
project is learning Python. I am using a HP Laptop w/intel PENTIUM, loaded with Windows 10, 64-bit. With Python3.6 I am coding with the
PyCharm IDE. I have been reading from 'A Begginer's Guide to Python' and others. I've also watched a ton of YouTube videos. If you
have the patients to deal with a completely clueless begginer please help me.
